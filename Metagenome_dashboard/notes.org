Hi Thomas,

Keep in mind this is solely based on my interest and not something any of the teams have requested.
However, if we have a tool like this, I am sure it will get used,
as long as it does not have a 30 second delay each time we filter or refresh.

It is for this csv file: /z/datasets/ds_mr_insilico/scheduled_notebooks/Gtdbtkfiles/gtdbtkmain_classification_summary.csv

Main subsetting and filtering will be on these: division,phylum,class,order,family,genus,species

However, not all the information is in there for the dashboard.
I intend to also extract source, geolocation etc using the sequoia id in organism_id etc.

Dashboard will have diversity metrics (still deciding what is the best one),
and also sunburst chart of the subset chosen, and  an interactable geolocation map of different strains.
For strains within same species I was also thinking of a similarity (or dissimilarity) plot so some kind
so we can see how good we were at sampling diverse strains.
